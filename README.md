# Vet Office Prototype built alongside Build Python Web Apps with Django

This application was designed to be hosted anywhere, but was hosted on PythonAnywhere, serving a prototype Veterinarian's Office web front and admin portal. Using this application, office staff can add, remove, and edit Clients and Pet Patients, while managing appointments - which can be added and modified by clients themselves.

For any questions, comments or feedback, please feel free to reach out! This was developed using solely self-taught techniques, and I am still learning!
